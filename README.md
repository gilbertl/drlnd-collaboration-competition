## Project Environment 

The Jupyter notebook in this repository trains two agents to bounce a ball over the net to each other.

The observation space for each agent consists of 24 variables corresponding to  to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. 

Each action is a vector with two numbers, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.
